# Backup setup: gecko-notes → Synology NAS

Sets up the `backup` service from `docker-compose.yml`: a sidecar that takes a
whole-database snapshot and pushes it, with the entire `data/media/` tree, to a
Synology NAS over SFTP on a schedule. See `docs/backup-strategy.md` for design
rationale. This file is the setup procedure.

All backup logic runs in the `backup` container on the gecko-notes host. Nothing
restic-specific runs on the NAS — it only needs its stock SFTP service.

gecko-notes runs on a separate remote host, so the NAS is reached over a router
port-forward. SSH is therefore genuinely exposed to the internet, and the steps
below lean on key-only auth, a non-default port, a locked-down account, a
source-IP firewall rule, and DSM's brute-force protection.

---

## Read this first: two undocumented DSM requirements

Two things are required that no Synology documentation mentions, and both fail
with an unhelpful `Permission denied (publickey,password)` and nothing useful in
the logs.

**1. `PubkeyAuthentication` is OFF in Synology's sshd build.** Stock OpenSSH
defaults it on. Synology's does not, and ships `sshd_config` with the line
commented out — which looks like "default applies" but isn't. Without an
explicit `PubkeyAuthentication yes`, sshd rejects every key at the offer stage
without ever reading `authorized_keys`.

**2. The backup account needs access to the `homes` share.** sshd reads
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys` as the target user. DSM puts an ACL on `/volume1/homes`,
and if the account is set to No Access on that share, sshd cannot traverse into
the account's own home. Symptom in a debug log:

```
debug1: Could not open authorized keys '.../authorized_keys': Permission denied
```

Setting `homes` to No Access looks like correct hardening. It silently breaks key
auth.

**Also worth knowing before you start:** DSM does not permit interactive SSH
shell logins for non-admin accounts. The backup account will never give you a
shell, by design. That is fine — restic uses the SFTP subsystem, not a shell.
Verify with `sftp`, never `ssh`.

Because of that, the way to run root commands on the NAS without enabling the SSH
terminal service is **Control Panel → Task Scheduler → Create → Scheduled Task →
User-defined script**, with User set to `root`. Untick "Enabled" so it never runs
on a schedule, then select it and click Run. Several steps below use this.

---

## 1. NAS: enable SFTP only

**Control Panel → File Services → FTP tab**

- Leave "Enable FTP service" and FTPS **unticked**. FTP and FTPS are different
  protocols from SFTP and you don't want them.
- Tick **Enable SFTP service**.
- Set a non-default port (e.g. `22022`). This is separate from the SSH port.
- Apply.

**Control Panel → Terminal & SNMP** — leave "Enable SSH service" **off**. SFTP
and SSH are independent services on DSM; SFTP works without the terminal service.

## 2. NAS: enable User Home service

**Control Panel → User & Group → Advanced tab → User Home** → tick **Enable user
home service** → Apply.

This is a global setting on the User & Group page, not a per-user one in the
account editor. It creates `/volume1/homes/<user>` for every account
automatically. No login required.

## 3. NAS: create the shared folder and account

**Control Panel → Shared Folder** → create a dedicated share, e.g. `GeckoNotes`.
Don't reuse a folder holding anything else.

**Control Panel → User & Group → User** → create a non-admin local user, e.g.
`gecko-notes-backup`.

**Permissions tab:**

| Share      | Access                                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `GeckoNotes` | Read/Write                                    |
| `homes`    | Read Only (required — see "Read this first")     |
| everything else | No Access                                  |

**Applications tab:** Allow **SFTP** explicitly. Set **DSM** to Deny so the
account cannot reach the web UI. Deny everything else.

## 4. Generate the keypair (on the gecko-notes host)

Generate on the host that will run the backups, not on the NAS and not on your
laptop. Only the public half ever leaves this machine.

```bash
cd /opt/gecko-notes/ops/backup
mkdir -p secrets && chmod 700 secrets
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f secrets/id_backup
chmod 600 secrets/id_backup
cat secrets/id_backup.pub
```

No passphrase, because nothing can type one at 3am. `secrets/` is gitignored —
the private key must never be committed.

The comment at the end of the public key (`user@hostname`) is a free-text label.
sshd ignores it. It does not need to match the NAS account name.

## 5. NAS: install the public key

Task Scheduler script, run as root. Paste your public key into `PUBKEY` as a
**single unbroken line** — DSM's task editor is a plain textarea and a wrapped
key produces a file that looks fine and fails silently.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
USER_NAME=gecko-notes-backup
HOME_DIR=$(grep "^$USER_NAME:" /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f6)
PUBKEY="ssh-ed25519 AAAA...paste-yours-here... comment"

mkdir -p "$HOME_DIR/.ssh"
echo "$PUBKEY" > "$HOME_DIR/.ssh/authorized_keys"
chown -R "$USER_NAME:users" "$HOME_DIR" "$HOME_DIR/.ssh"
chmod 755 "$HOME_DIR"
chmod 700 "$HOME_DIR/.ssh"
chmod 600 "$HOME_DIR/.ssh/authorized_keys"

# verify
{
  ls -ld "$HOME_DIR" "$HOME_DIR/.ssh"
  ls -l "$HOME_DIR/.ssh/authorized_keys"
  wc -l "$HOME_DIR/.ssh/authorized_keys"
} > /volume1/GeckoNotes/keycheck.txt 2>&1
```

Read `keycheck.txt` via File Station. Home should be `755` owned by the user,
`.ssh` `700`, `authorized_keys` `600`, and the line count exactly **1**. A count
of 2+ means the key wrapped on paste.

The script derives `HOME_DIR` from `/etc/passwd` rather than hardcoding it. If
User Home service hasn't taken effect, a hardcoded `mkdir -p` will happily create
a directory tree sshd never consults.

Re-running this script overwrites `authorized_keys` rather than appending, so
it's safe to run again with a new key.

## 6. NAS: enable public key authentication

The step Synology doesn't document. Task Scheduler, root:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
CONF=/etc/ssh/sshd_config
cp "$CONF" "$CONF.bak"

sed -i '/^[[:space:]]*#*[[:space:]]*PubkeyAuthentication/d' "$CONF"
sed -i '/^[[:space:]]*#*[[:space:]]*AuthorizedKeysFile/d' "$CONF"
sed -i 's|^PasswordAuthentication yes|PasswordAuthentication yes\nPubkeyAuthentication yes\nAuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys|' "$CONF"

grep -v '^#' "$CONF" | grep -v '^$' > /volume1/GeckoNotes/sshdconf.txt 2>&1
```

Check `sshdconf.txt` shows both new lines **above** any `Match User` blocks.
Directives after a `Match` block apply only to those users.

Restart SFTP: Control Panel → File Services → FTP tab, untick Enable SFTP
service, Apply, re-tick, Apply. Then re-check `sshdconf.txt` — the toggle
sometimes rewrites `sshd_config`.

**This edit does not survive DSM updates.** See "Maintenance" below.

## 7. NAS: lock it down

- **Control Panel → Security → Protection** → enable **Auto Block** (e.g. 5
  attempts in 5 minutes, block permanently).
- **Control Panel → Security → Firewall** → allow the SFTP port only from the
  gecko-notes host's public IP; deny everything else on that port.
- **Router** → forward an external non-default port to the NAS's SFTP port.
  Restrict the forward to the source IP if your provider allows it.

Get the gecko-notes host's real outbound address from the host itself, not by
resolving its domain — a proxy or CDN in front of the app will give you the wrong
answer:

```bash
curl -4 ifconfig.me
```

If that host's IP is dynamic, a source-IP rule will silently break your backups
when it rotates.

## 8. gecko-notes host: pin the NAS host key

```bash
cd /opt/gecko-notes
ssh-keyscan -p <port> <ddns-or-public-ip> > ops/backup/secrets/known_hosts
ssh-keygen -lf ops/backup/secrets/known_hosts
```

`ssh-keyscan` verifies nothing — it accepts whatever answers. Compare the
fingerprint against the NAS's real key. **DSM does not display a host key
fingerprint anywhere in the UI**, so get it with a Task Scheduler script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
for f in /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*_key; do ssh-keygen -lf "$f"; done \
  > /volume1/GeckoNotes/hostkeys.txt
```

Match the ED25519 line. That comparison is what establishes trust; skipping it
defeats the point of `StrictHostKeyChecking`. Delete `hostkeys.txt` afterwards.

**`known_hosts` must exist as a real file before any `docker compose` command.**
`docker-compose.yml` bind-mounts it, and Docker creates a **directory** at any
bind-mount source that doesn't exist. Nothing errors; you just get an empty
directory where a file should be, and confusing failures later. Same applies to
`id_backup`. If you find directories there:

```bash
rmdir ops/backup/secrets/id_backup ops/backup/secrets/known_hosts
```

## 9. Test SFTP with the key

The gate. Nothing downstream works until this does.

```bash
sftp -i ops/backup/secrets/id_backup \
     -o IdentitiesOnly=yes \
     -o PreferredAuthentications=publickey \
     -o UserKnownHostsFile=ops/backup/secrets/known_hosts \
     -P <port> <user>@<host>
```

`PreferredAuthentications=publickey` matters. Without it a broken key silently
falls back to the password and you won't discover the problem until the container
fails unattended.

Once connected:

```
sftp> pwd
sftp> ls
sftp> cd GeckoNotes
sftp> put /etc/hostname writetest.txt
sftp> rm writetest.txt
```

Synology chroots the user, so `pwd` at login returns `/` — that is the chroot
root, not the filesystem root. The share appears inside it as `/GeckoNotes`. Use
that, never `/volume1/GeckoNotes`.

## 10. Fill `.env`

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Save that string in a password manager **before** using it. restic encrypts
client-side; losing it makes every existing snapshot permanently unrecoverable.

```
RESTIC_PASSWORD=<generated above>
BACKUP_SFTP_HOST=<ddns hostname or public IP>
BACKUP_SFTP_PORT=<forwarded port>
BACKUP_SFTP_USER=gecko-notes-backup
BACKUP_SFTP_REMOTE_PATH=/GeckoNotes/restic
```

The `/restic` subdirectory keeps the repo's `data/`, `snapshots/` and `keys/`
from scattering across the share root. `restic init` creates it.

Edit `.env`, not `.env.example` — that stays a template.

## 11. Init and first run

```bash
docker compose build backup
docker compose run --rm backup restic init
docker compose run --rm backup /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
docker compose up -d backup
```

`restic init` is one-time and creates the repository on the NAS. The third line
forces an immediate backup instead of waiting for the first cron tick.

`docker compose run --rm` creates a throwaway container each time, so it always
picks up current files. `docker compose restart` does **not** — bind mounts and
environment variables are resolved at container *creation*. After changing `.env`
or anything in `secrets/`:

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate backup
```

## 12. Verify

```bash
docker compose run --rm backup restic snapshots
docker logs backup
docker inspect <container> --format '{{.HostConfig.RestartPolicy.Name}}'
docker compose exec backup crontab -l
```

One snapshot listed means the chain works. Confirm the restart policy is
`unless-stopped` or `always`, or the container won't return after a host reboot.
Check `docker logs backup` again after the next scheduled tick — an unattended
run is the only real proof.

## Maintenance

**The `sshd_config` edit from step 6 does not survive DSM updates**, and may not
survive toggling the SFTP service. When it's reverted, backups fail silently.

Add a **Triggered Task → Boot-up**, User `root`, with the step 6 script body.
Re-run it manually after any DSM update, and re-check `sshdconf.txt`.

Consider putting Tailscale on both machines and dropping the port-forward
entirely. Synology has a package; the host takes one command. The backup then
runs over a private tailnet address, nothing is exposed to the internet, and the
firewall rule, non-default port and Auto Block stop being load-bearing.

---

## Troubleshooting

The client-side error is always the same unhelpful `Permission denied
(publickey,password)`. Get the server's actual reason instead.

### Read sshd's reasoning directly

Task Scheduler, root. Runs a debug sshd on a spare port that logs why it refused:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
timeout 180 /usr/bin/sshd -ddd -p 2299 -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config \
  > /volume1/GeckoNotes/sshd_debug.txt 2>&1
```

Connect to port 2299 within three minutes from a machine on the LAN (that port
isn't forwarded). It accepts one connection and exits.

Note: Synology's sshd only enables the sftp subsystem on the *configured* SFTP
port, so a debug daemon on another port will authenticate you and then report
`subsystem request failed`. That's expected. Authentication is what you're
testing.

What to look for:

| Log line | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `Could not open authorized keys: Permission denied` | `homes` share access — step 3 |
| No `trying public key file` line at all | `PubkeyAuthentication` off — step 6 |
| `matching key found` then `Accepted publickey` | Auth is working |
| `Authentication refused: bad ownership or modes` | Permissions on home/`.ssh`/`authorized_keys` — step 5 |

### Check the client is offering the key

```bash
sftp -vvv -i <key> -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -P <port> <user>@<host>
```

`Offering public key:` followed by no `Server accepts key:` means the server
rejected it before requesting a signature — server-side, not a client problem.
Compare the offered fingerprint against what's stored on the NAS:

```bash
ssh-keygen -lf <path>/id_backup.pub          # on the host
ssh-keygen -lf <home>/.ssh/authorized_keys   # on the NAS, via Task Scheduler
```

### Things that look like the problem but aren't

Each of these was tried during the original setup and none of them mattered:

- **Login shell `/sbin/nologin`.** DSM assigns it to non-admin accounts and
  resets it on reboot. Irrelevant here — `internal-sftp` needs no shell.
- **Membership of `administrators`.** Required for interactive SSH shells, not
  for SFTP key auth. Don't grant it; it puts a privileged account behind an
  internet-facing port.
- **`chmod 711` on `.ssh`.** Frequently recommended online. `700` is correct and
  works.
- **`StrictModes` on parent directories.** Worth checking, but DSM's defaults
  (`/volume1/homes` at `711` root-owned) are already correct.

### Other notes

- **`synoservicectl` doesn't exist on DSM 7.** It's `synosystemctl`.
- **File Station won't show `.ssh`** (hidden directory) and can't reliably set
  Unix modes on ACL-managed shares. Use Task Scheduler scripts.
- **`/var/services/homes` is a symlink to `/volume1/homes`.** Either path works.

---

## Later: second destination

`docs/backup-strategy.md` describes fanning the same backup out to an off-site
S3-compatible bucket for geographic redundancy. Deliberately deferred. Adding it
means a second `restic backup ... -r <bucket-repo>` and its own `restic forget`
in `backup.sh`, with separate credentials. No changes to the NAS setup above.
